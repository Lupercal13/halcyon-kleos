        British DJ/Producer specializing in organ house music. I have been
        interested in the this particular style since the release of 'Robin S -
        Show Me Love' and 'Nightcrawlers - Push The Feeling On' from back in the
        90's. The 'Organ' has continued it's progression throughout the years
        becoming one of the most distinctive and loved sounds in dance music
        history. It has found it's way into many genres and continues to
        transition through current mainstream and underground music.
